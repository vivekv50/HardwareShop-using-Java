Project Title: 
Hardware Shop Management System (Console-Based Application)
Description:
The Hardware Shop Management System is a console-based application developed using Core Java to streamline and simplify the management of hardware store operations. This project demonstrates the use of various Core Java concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, collections framework, exception handling, file handling, and user interaction through the console.


Technologies and Concepts Used:
Core Java: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Collections Framework: ArrayList, HashMap, etc., for data management.
Exception Handling: To handle invalid inputs and runtime errors gracefully.
Loops and Control Structures: For program flow control.
Input/Output Streams: For user interaction and file operations.
